# Hot Wax for Gideros 

**WARNING** - You should not check out this repo directly, it should be checked out as a submodule of [BhGideros](https://github.com/troysandal/BhGideros).


[Wax](https://github.com/troysandal/wax) is a Lua <-> Objective C bridge by [Corey Johnson](https://github.com/probablycorey).  This repository contains the [Wax plugin](./Plugin) for [Gideros SDK](http://giderosmobile.com), a [Gideros Player](./Player) with wax built in (great for prototyping) and a [Demo Project](./Demo) that shows off what wax can do in Gideros.
